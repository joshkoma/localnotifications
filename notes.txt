STEP 1: 
import Packages: Add Packages to pubspec.yaml which include 
flutter local notifications
flutter time zone
rxdart

STEP 2: 
update build.gradle
-add multixex enabled in build.gradle, this can be found in the pubdev page for futter llocal notifications
-add core library under compileOptions
-add core library under dependencies as well
-add classpath under main build.gradle //see note below (i commented it out and file still run)

STEP 3
-add initialization block to main page , static future init funciton (reminders page)
-onDidreveivenotification for iOs pass null
-create FlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin _flutterLocalNotificationsPlugin and initialize, pass value
-run init block in main.dart

STEP 4
-Call test notification, you can set the required variables such as title, body and payload
-Copy and paste display notification codeblock from pubdev
-Copy same codeblock and use periodic notification code block for the periodic type, remember repeat interval is a class type












NOTE: THIS PROJECT RUNS ON KOTLIN VER 1.7.X WHICH STILL INCLUDES BULDSCRIPT.  IF YOU UPGRADE TO A PROJECT THAT USERS A NEWER VERSION OF FLUTTER, THEN YOU WILL 
NEED TO GO TO ANDROID/SETTINGS.GRADLE, UNDER PLUGINS, FIND id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.android" version "1.7.10" apply false AND CHANGE TO VERSION 1.9.0
According to stack overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70938297/how-to-add-classpath-in-new-version-of-android-studio you can manually add the buildscript block in the 
project level gradle and also top level gradle
EXAMPLE
If this was your old buildscript
Buildscript {
     // ...

     dependencies {
         // ...
-        classpath "com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0"
-        classpath "com.google.firebase:firebase-crashlytics-gradle:2.9.9"
     }
 }
 Remove these two lines from app level build.gradle
 -apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
-apply plugin: 'com.google.firebase.crashlytics'

add this to top level settings.gradle
+    id "com.google.gms.google-services" version "4.4.0" apply false
+    id "com.google.firebase.crashlytics" version "2.9.9" apply false

add this to app build.gradle
+    id "com.google.gms.google-services"
+    id "com.google.firebase.crashlytics"
